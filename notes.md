## What is Nest Js
* Nest Js is a Node Js backend framework that embraces TypeScript and solves the weak point of Express Js which is architecture
    * It provides direction on have to structure and scale a project, while still using Express Js under the hood
* It allows for creation of testable, scalable, and easily maintainable applications
* Modularity is important for Nest Js and uses concepts like dependency injection (has been called Angular for backend)
* Nest Js provides good structure and modularity for apps, has support for TypeScript, GraphQL, microservices, and REST APIs

## Installing Nest Js
```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new <project-name>
```

## Modules
* app.module.ts is similar to the App file in a React or Vue application - it is the main module/the app that will import other modules
    * "A module is a class annotated with a @Module() decorator. The @Module() decorator provides metadata that Nest makes use of to organize the application structure."
* The export keyword allows a Module to be available across an application, otherwise it will only be available within a specific file - make sure to also import a module in the App imports statement
* main.ts is where the app is launched (manually change the port number from 3000 since 3000 is the default port number for REact)
* Nest CLI has an option to allow automatic generation of modules - it also automatically imports the module into the app
```
nest g module <name-of-module>
```

## Controllers and Services
* The logic for a Nest Js application is separated into two files - controllers and service
    * "Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client." (annotated with @Controller())
    * Services (aka providers) are responsible for executing the business logic: "Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can be injected as a dependency; this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" these objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system." (annotated with @Injectable())
* Don't forget to import the service and controller into the module file
* The controller receives a request from the internet and it calls a function from the service before returning the result of that function to the browser
* In classic JavaScript, the controller would have to instantiate an instance of the Service before being able to use it
* In Nest Js, we use dependency injection, which means that instead of the controller declaring and handling a new insance of the service, it receives the service as an argument in its constructor and Nest Js handles the instatiation of the service
    * Dependency injection in Nest Js basically allows us to not have to handle dependency management
* Nest Js also converts the datatype in the headers of the response based on the datatype of the returned value
* The controllers handle the request and return the body if needed - might check headers or any work required by the request - the execution is offloaded to the service
* Usually the pattern is that there is a matching function in the service for each of the routes defined in the controller

## Connecting a Containerized Database and ORM
* In the root directory, create a docker-compose.yml file and use the following command to run the docker database container
```
docker compose up dev-db -d
```
* You can also check the status of the container by using the following command
```
docker logs <container-id>
```
* This tutorial uses postgres relational database and uses Prisma as the ORM
    * Prisma is like a query builder where you define a model and you can get those models from your JS or TS code
* Primsa will be used to define the database connection logic
* Install Prisma CLI to create schemas, run migrations, and deploy migrations into the database
```
npm i prisma@latest --save-dev
```
* Install Prisma client - Prisma has many clients, so we're installing the one for JavaScript
```
npm i @prisma/client
```
* Once installed, initialize Prisma by running
```
npx prisma init
```
* This will generate several files including a .env file (which contains a default postgres connection string that needs to be updated with the correct user, password, port, and database variables) and a prisma directory in the root directory which has a schema file where we will declare our models (similar to GraphQL)
    * Uses the prisma client js library and postgrest (but Prisma also supports MySQL and MongoDB)
    * The Url is the connection string which grabs the value from the first environment file it finds (here it's the .env in the root folder, but if there was a .dnv in the prisma folder, it would use that one)
* The Prisma schema file uses Prisma syntax

## Running Prisma Migrations
* After creating the models in the schema file, run the following command
```
npx prisma migrate dev
```
* This will generate the migrations in the prisma folder
    * The dev version of this command will delete the data, but there is another command that can be run for production to avoid this
* The migrate dev command automatically runs the generate command (npx prisma generate - which creates Typescript types for the schema and allows us to directly use those types in our code) and also pushes the migrations to the database (can view it in the docker logs for the db container)
* Prisma also provides a GUI, which can be initialized using
```
npx prisma studio
```
